# 🐦 Python-Flappybird-Game

A simple clone of the classic Flappy Bird game built using Python and Pygame.

## 🖼 Demo

## 🎮 Game Description

Flappy Bird is a side-scrolling arcade-style game where the player controls a bird attempting to fly between columns of pipes without hitting them. This implementation recreates the core mechanics and gameplay loop using Pygame.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To launch the game, simply run:

```
python game.py
```

## 📚 Concepts Learned

During the development of this project, the following key game development concepts were explored:

### 🔁 Game Loop Structure

- Event Processing: Handling user input like key presses.
- Gameplay Processing: Updating game state (e.g. bird movement, collision detection).
- Rendering: Drawing the game elements to the screen every frame.

### 🎞️ Frames Per Second (FPS)

Understanding the importance of FPS for smooth gameplay, and how to control it using Pygame’s clock functionality.

### 🧭 Coordinate System in Pygame

- Origin (0, 0) is at the top-left corner.
- The X-axis increases to the right.
- The Y-axis increases downward.

```
(0, 0) ---> +X

  v
 +Y
```

## 🛠 Features

- Basic bird physics with gravity and jump mechanics
- Randomized pipe generation
- Collision detection
- Score tracking
- Game over and restart logic
